# Samsung-Gear-Portal-Data-Extraction

#### Overview

The Samsung Gear Portal Data Extraction code is a demonstration of data analytics and engineering abilities, showcasing techniques such as data mining and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). This code addresses the issue of manual data extraction from the Samsung Gear Portal, specifically regarding the last login time. By automating the data extraction and transformation process, it streamlines the process of generating reports and provides personal usage benefits.

#### Problem Statement

The Samsung Gear Portal lacks the functionality to export user data, including the critical information of the last login time. Extracting and transferring rows of data to Excel manually can be a laborious task, prone to errors, and time-consuming for reporting and personal usage purposes.

#### Solution

This code automates the data extraction process from the Samsung Gear Portal and performs the following steps:

1. Extracts the total number of users from the web page using data mining techniques.
2. Sets the select element value to display all rows for comprehensive data retrieval.
3. Calculates the "Days Since Last Login" for each user based on their login timestamp.
4. Generates a CSV file with the extracted and transformed data, ready for analysis and reporting.


#### Usage and Personal Benefits
The code can be utilized to generate reports and facilitate personal data analysis. By running the code, you can extract the necessary user data, including the last login time, and export it as a CSV file. The benefits include:

- Time Savings: Automation eliminates manual data entry, reducing effort and saving time.
- Data Accuracy: Automated extraction ensures accurate and reliable information for reporting and analysis.
- Personal Insights: The extracted data enables personal analysis to gain insights into user activity and patterns.
- Report Generation: The generated CSV file can be used to generate reports, supporting data-driven decision-making.
