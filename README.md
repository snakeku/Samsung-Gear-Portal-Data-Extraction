# Samsung-Gear-Portal-Data-Extraction

#### Overview

The Samsung Gear Portal Data Extraction code is a demonstration of data mining, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, creation and insertion of data into a MySQL database and data analysis of data. This code addresses the issue of manual data extraction from the Samsung Gear Portal, specifically regarding the last login time. By automating the data extraction and transformation process, it streamlines the process of generating reports and provides personal usage benefits.

#### Problem Statement

The Samsung Gear Portal lacks the functionality to export user data, including the critical information of the last login time. Extracting and transferring rows of data to Excel manually can be a laborious task, prone to errors, and time-consuming for reporting and personal usage purposes.

#### Solution

This project offers an end-to-end solution by combining JavaScript, Python and MySQL database to automate the data extraction and analytics process:

Data Mining with JavaScript: JavaScript is used to extract data directly from the Samsung Gear Portal webpage. Leveraging the browser as a JavaScript runtime environment, the code dynamically navigates the webpage, retrieves the necessary data elements, and captures the required information, including user details and last login timestamps.

Exporting to CSV: The extracted data is then processed and formatted using JavaScript to generate a CSV file. This file serves as an intermediate data storage format, enabling seamless integration with Python for further analysis.

Data Analytics with Python: After the data is exported to CSV, the Python code takes over for further processing, transformation, and analysis. It connects to a MySQL database, creates tables for storing user information and login activity, and inserts the extracted data. Python's rich ecosystem of libraries, such as pandas and matplotlib, can be utilized to perform in-depth data analysis, generate reports, and create visualizations.

Data Engineering and Visualization: With the data stored in a MySQL database, you can leverage your data engineering skills to optimize database operations, ensure data integrity, and create efficient queries. Additionally, you can showcase your data visualization skills by using libraries like seaborn or plotly to create insightful visualizations and interactive dashboards that provide a deeper understanding of user behavior and trends.

By combining JavaScript for data mining on the webpage and Python for data processing, analysis, and visualisation, this solution demonstrates a comprehensive approach to extracting, transforming, and analysing data from the Samsung Gear Portal.


#### Usage and Personal Benefits
The code can be utilized to generate reports and facilitate personal data analysis. By running the code, you can extract the necessary user data, including the last login time, and export it as a CSV file. The benefits include:

- Time Savings: Automation eliminates manual data entry, reducing effort and saving time.
- Data Accuracy: Automated extraction ensures accurate and reliable information for reporting and analysis.
- Personal Insights: The extracted data enables personal analysis to gain insights into user activity and patterns.
- Report Generation: The generated CSV file can be used to generate reports, supporting data-driven decision-making.
